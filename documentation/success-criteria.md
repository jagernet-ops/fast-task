### Refined Success Criteria:
>Over the course of Fast Task's development after meetings with advisor we settled upon a singular categorization method for the application. During the initial ideation phase of the project I alongside my advisor thought up multiple potential methods for organizing the tasks generated by users. However, as the project developed we made the design decision to condense these extraneous methods into a single category descriptor alongside many filterable properties.
